     <p>
        His family has been owning a worldwide known company for years now which has been passed down since generations. Madara as the next heir in line took over the company after his father retired, his younger brother Izuna is his closest advisor in this business, the young man doesn’t tend to listen very carefully to what the eldest of his clan have to say. They’re family so he respects them but they’re also incredibly boring. He’s CEO of the company in a time where a lot changes for his company since after years of rivalry with the Senju business, both companies have finally started a partnership. Something only possible because the CEO from the Senju, Hashirama, has been a friend of Madara since childhood. Hashi’s determination and Madara’s stubbornness against the eldest ended years of fights and rivalries.<br>

        Business thrives after both of them start working together, even if either the Senju nor the Uchiha really want to admit it out loud. No worries though, Madara teases them enough for it. During business meetings he tends to bonk heads with Hashirama’s little brother since both don’t get along very well. They constantly try to outsmart and provoke each other, Hashirama is left to soothe both sides. He’s sort of strict and has high expectations for the people he hires, it isn’t easy to impress him. People fear and love him simultaneously, something that amuses him. He bathed a little bit in the admiration he’s showered in, hesitates not to shoot someone rudely down if they turn out to be too persistent and full of themselves. His clan has tried already to set him up, he’s rejected every single candidate so far though.<br>
        
        ​His sudden interest in you torments you a bit because he loves riling you up a bit, both of you constantly butt each other's head and the man seems to enjoy it a lot more than you. God knows what he wants from you because he is obviously the one picking the fight yet your co-workers always scold you because they don't have the courage to talk bad about Madara. He's intimidating all of them yet you are able to ignore that if something makes you snap and to be  fair, Madara enjoys that. It's rare to have someone talking back to him, exceptions are his own clan and the Senju clan. You on the other hand are refreshing and whilst you aren't the most talented person you seem to at least be bold enough to bristle up against him whenever he scares a newbie. He isn't really ashamed to admit to his brother that he sometimes digs up information about you or uses cameras in the building to his advantage.<br>
        
        ​A small change happens where he seems to be in a better mood and to his horror and surprise Hashirama discovers what is going on and encourages his friend to bring you over, to fight for your heart. He never talks with his friend about it though because he knows what he'll have to endure. Sadly the Senju man is sneakier than expected and so one evening after a couple of bottles Madara opens his heart a bit and talks about feisty you and regrets it forever afterwards. Tobirama especially seems to torture him with it and Madara found himself only that much away from punching him in the face. His admiration doesn't stay hidden for long because soon he really starts courting you. Bouquets of flowers thrice the size of the average, a sudden involvement in his own work, champagne and wine as a reward for your hard work and an invitation from Hashirama to join a friendly meeting.<br>
        
        ​He is possessive and becomes dangerously touchy with you over time, especially when he is feeling possessive or jealous. When you talk with a very friendly co-worker in which case you suddenly feel an arm being swung around your shoulders with Madara giving the other person a very scary smirk. He takes you often out with him and everyone knows that he sees such activities as dates. He eventually confesses his feelings after a while, something you have been expecting for a while now. When you finally receive and invitation to a family dinner with his clan, everyone knows that he is serious. The man himself is a bit concerned that the eldest will hector you or not accept you, he is rather protective during the entire evening. Izuna is a sweetheart to you though. Once you are in a relationship, you won't get out and you'll find the word marriage coming up frighteningly often. He just seems to ignore your feelings about his behavior.

     <a href=https://naruto.fandom.com/ru/wiki/%D0%A5%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0_%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B6%D1%83><h3>Hashirama</h3></a>
    <p>
     ​Some business people may wonder how the heck someone as goofy as Hashirama manages to hold together such a huge branch yet he is more shrewd and analytic than many might notice at first glance. He is incredibly convincing, it's just something about his personality that manages to make him so likeable and he also has a reputation for being very loyal and caring. A man who stands for his word. That is why he even managed to finally break the ice between the Uchiha and Senju company and tied both of them with the help of Madara, CEO of the Uchiha company, together. He throws a big party after he achieved that goal of his and works together with Madara and Izuna and his own brother eagerly together to draw out the best of the new partnership. It works as well, both companies prosper under the new contract.<br>

     ​If it wouldn't be for the light hostility between his brother and Madara, things would be ideal but Hashi is determined to make those two buddies as well. He always gets horrified faces from the two when he tells them about this plan, at least both seem to agree that Hashi is definitely living in a dream world if he seriously expects those two to get along. His brother is his closest advisor, sometimes even takes over the position if he sees it as needed. Otherwise he just drags Hashirama to his office and makes sure that he works. He is a CEO who wants to be socially active with his workers in order to get along with them and create a good environment to work with so it isn't uncommon for him to walk around and chat with them or give out a cup of coffee or sake on special days which he celebrates within the company.<br>

     ​Something just seems to click instantly between him and his darling as soon as he welcomes them in his company, something he always does with new co-workers. You are a bit different because he feels like he just gets along especially well with you. When he sees you, he usually always takes a few minutes longer to talk more with you and finds himself opening up about things he normally wouldn't talk instantly about with someone. Hashirama finds himself admiring everything you do, notices every single thing about you and commits everything you tell him to memory. He feels excited to meet you and when you give him a smile, his heart seems to jump around in his chest. Soon he finds himself spacing out during work, his thoughts circling around you and he misses you even if you two are in the same company. His brother notices quickly that he has his head in the clouds.<br>

     ​He likes you and that is obvious. Whilst he is friendly, he is extremely friendly with you, always reserves a smile for you even after a exhausting day and cares especially much about your health. If you have too much stress, he'll lift a bit of work from your shoulders and if he feels like you're worried about something, he is willing to help. It does not take long for him to ask you out for a date with an excited grin on his face and he is thrilled when you agree with a shy smile yourself. He is being extra though for a first date, mainly because he wants to impress you which is actually sort of sweet. His sudden request during the first date to be his partner might startle you because it might be a bit too sudden so when you reject and ask for more time, he feels like a kicked puppy. Somehow he manages to accept though even if he seems to be a bit more gloomy the following days.<br>

     ​He doesn't give up easy and it is a bit more hard to see his darker side, mainly because he is so sweet and attentive. It is only after you finally agreed to be in a relationship that you slowly see what is wrong. Hashirama is clingy and overly affectionate, he can barely leave you by yourself most of the time. The biggest flag for you is his sudden talk about marriage and, if you can bear kids, children as well. Barely a month after you two are together he already fantasizes about those things and tells you about it. As soon as he introduces you to his clan you realize that they aren't really different with the whole aspect of marriage and it makes you a bit uncomfortable. So when you tell him that you feel like he wants to progress too fast, chances are that you'll figure out how delusional he really is. The short time you've known each other feels already like eternity for him and in his eyes you two are soulmates and share something special.

     <p>
     Whilst Hashirama is the main head of the clan and the one who took over the company, Tobirama has just as much influence and control. He’s literally the unofficial CEO next to his brother, more than just an advisor and his second hand. He goes through the paperwork as well, meets the clients and discusses contracts with them. Sometimes it is even him sitting in the office instead of Hashirama when that man is currently somewhere else. He’s the one who grabs his brother by the collar and reminds him that he has work to do and he’ll stay the whole time in the office if that is what it takes to have Hashi finish his work. Tobirama, still respectful, doesn’t coddle the co-workers quite as much though, he is stricter, expects everyone to do their best in their job and isn’t afraid to give someone a sturdy scolding.<br>

     He has had some unfortunate meetings with someone from the Uchiha clan so he isn’t exactly thrilled when his brother suddenly plans to start a partnership with them. Tobirama doesn’t trust them if he has to be completely honest yet he accepts Hashirama’s wish after a while and works to fulfill that dream. With gritted teeth that is. Madara and him still don’t get along and he’d rather smash his head against a wall than endure that guy or be alone in the same room as him since Madara makes him lose his temper quickly. He’s popular under the co-workers, doesn’t accept presents and confessions as humbly as his brother who goes out of his way to thank a person. Most of the time he just sends the presents back. He’s more focused on work and if a person is rather persistent and overly confident, he tends to be more harsh with his choice of words.<br>

     Originally you were just supposed to be a secretary for his brother yet he also gets to know you due to working as the second CEO for the company. And let’s just say that he admires what he sees. You’re hardworking, patient, polite, smart and aren’t afraid to point out wrong behavior or to give your honest opinion. He’s flustered the first time you suddenly kick him out of the office late at night by telling him that he should get rest and that you can’t leave if he doesn’t leave first. In a way you are a mix of him and his brother. You want people to finish the work they’re suppose to do yet also know how important it is to relax and interact with people for a good relationship. He dreads and admires this about you at the same time, isn’t sure how to feel when you scold him though for working too much. His brother has the time of his life watching this though.<br>

     He notices his obsession quickly and initially distances himself from you, unsure how to feel about this. He feels ashamed and humiliated simultaneously and it isn’t good for his own ego yet he knows he can’t avoid the company forever. He has work to do and after a while he feels his defenses also crumbling down because he hasn’t seen you for a while. When he returns, he apologizes for his absence and starts working with you again. He is determined to overcome this and hide his feelings yet you worm your way into his heart. You two just work so well together that by now you know what he needs without him even having to say anything and it flatters and flusters Tobirama. He finds his indifferent facade crumbling as he mellows out. His gaze lingers now longer on you, he uses a softer tone when speaking with you and gives you compliments for your excellent work.<br>

     He confesses one day privately in his house after he’s invited you over. He has been fighting to confess for a longer time now since he feels like you two are very close by now and also because it becomes harder to hide his growing possessive behavior. Relieved when you decide to give this a chance. Hashi jokes afterwards that he stole his secretary because Tobirama makes your schedule his own, you two work closely together. More open to stare someone down if they flirt with you. He tries to keep the relationship under the co-workers professional, behind closed doors he’s a bit more affectionate. Invites you over to meet his family and actually a bit jittery about what you feel think about each other. He’s quite controlling though and has moments where his possessive nature shines through. He is inwardly startled, stays calm though and tries to talk to you and tell you that you’re exaggerating a bit. Please don’t make things complicated, he doesn’t want you to hate him.
